## Recursive programming in Lisp (I)

Problem 7:
- Write a function that checks if a list is linear
- Define a function that substitues the first appearance of an element within a given list
- Substitute each sublist of a list with its last element <br>
Example: (a (b c) (d (e (f)))) ==> (a c (e (f))) ==> (a c (f)) ==> (a c f)
- Define a function that merges two linear and sorted lists. Duplicates should be removed
