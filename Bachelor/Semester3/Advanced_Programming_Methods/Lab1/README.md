## Lab 1

Various complex numbers in the form of `a+b*i` and an operation `(+,-,*,/)` are given as command line arguments.
<br>
Verify if the arguments are in the form of `n1 op n2 op ... op nk`, where `n1, n2, ..., nk` are the complex numbers and `op`, the given operation.
<br>
If the given expression is valid, compute it.
