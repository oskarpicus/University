## Gradient Descent

Same problem statement as [Lab 7](../Lab7), solved this time using Batch Gradient Descent, both with `sklearn` and from scratch.
This problem is also solved as a multivariate regression problem, taking as features the GDP of the country and its freedom level.

A regression problem with multiple outputs is solved as well, using the `linnerud` dataset from `sklearn`.
