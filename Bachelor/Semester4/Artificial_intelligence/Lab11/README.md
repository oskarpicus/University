## kMeans

Implementation of the kMeans algorithm, used then for the iris recognition problem and for the problem of recognising the emotion behind a text. This latter problem is also solved using a supervised algorithm (the ANN implementation from `sklearn`) and a hybrid technique, which combines ANN and kMeans.
