## Artificial Neural Network

Same problem as [Lab 9](../Lab9), solved this time using an ANN. Implementations of the algorithm using both `sklearn` and by scratch are provided.

Using the same implementation of the algorithm, the problem of determining whether a picture has the sepia filter or not is also solved. This same problem was solved using the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm as well.
