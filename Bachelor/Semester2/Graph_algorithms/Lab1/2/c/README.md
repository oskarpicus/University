## Problem c)

Let there be a graph with its adjacency matrix in a text file. The input file contains the number of nodes N, and the next N lines contain each N binary values, representing the adjacency matrix. Determine the distance matrix. The output file will contain N lines, each with N values, representing the distance matrix. If there is no path between 2 nodes, the matrix will contain the -1 value on the corresponding positions.
