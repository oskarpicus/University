## Problem b)

Let there be a graph which will be read from a text file. The file contains on the first line the number of nodes N and the number of edges M; the next M lines contain the graph's edges. Determine if the graph is regular. The output file will contain a single value: 1, if the graph is regular, 0, otherwise.
