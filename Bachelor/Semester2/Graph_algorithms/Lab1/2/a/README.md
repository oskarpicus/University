## Problem a)

Let there be a graph which will be read from a text file. The file contains on the first line the number of nodes N and the number of edges M; the next M lines contain the graph's edges. Determine the isolated nodes of the graph. The output file will contain a single line with the isolated nodes, in increasing order.
