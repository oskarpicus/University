Let there be a graph with its adjacency matrix in a text file. The input file contains the number of nodes N, and the next N lines contain each N binary values, representing the adjacency matrix. Determine if the graph is connected. The output file will contain a single value: 1, if the graph is connected, 0, otherwise.
